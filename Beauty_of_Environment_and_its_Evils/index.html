            A cloud is above us.<br>
            
            No, this isn't the life giving wonder we have all come to love. This is a new cloud that has used its God-given powers to smoother the true meaning of life.<br>
            This cloud is also reffered to as a society. Society has placed us into a standard that we are obliged to keep even though we never signed a wavier giving it permission. this unnecessary aspect of society as limited us from being our true happy selves as we are continously mocked and judged for the way we were born to act.<br>
            But, yet we still believe we are in control of our lives even thoughwe let a inanimate object whose sole purpose is to improve our daily lives subconsciously hold us captive. we cant leave the house without it, we can't locate anything without it, we can't FUNCTION without it.Our lives are being controlled by something that can't even choose right from wrong yet we live by it, yet we swear by it. <br>
            That is why we must go into nature.Dare i say, that is why we must protect nature. Nature is the only place where one can be liberated from the compressing standards of society and live the life they were entitled to. Live the life we are ALL entitled to. No clutter, no stress, no distractions only beauty, fine, crisp beauty, Nature has no standards ,it accepts everyone and all are welcome to enjoy its gifts.But at the rate we are going, these gifts will soon expire and life as we know it will change forever.So go out, get dirty, be free, and respect NATURE. <br>
            We can't have a society completly free from all the social evils. Yes, we can surely reduce social evils to a larger degree.
            To remove and reduce social evils:<br>

            <ul type="disc">
                <li>We need to spread education. Every person must be educated. 
                <li>We must focus on character building.Children must be training to have a sound character.Moral education is a must to reduce social evils. 
                <li>We must promote yoga and meditation at primary schools. 
                <li>We must organize awareness camps at villages and towns to make people aware of the bad effects of all the social evils. 
            </ul><br>                
            There are many more things that can be done to make our society more beautiful and peaceful but the most important thing that has the solution to this problem is nothing but YOU. If you start being better and more beautiful at heart, the society will automatically became more beautiful. <br> 
            At last but not the least..Be a teacher to yourself.<br> 
            After all this..Social evils might go down to a great extend but can't vanish.....As we are humans and humans can have mental disorders that an evil might be a result of.

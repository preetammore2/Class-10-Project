            Global warming is the increase in the average temperature of the Earth's near-surface air and oceans since the mid-20th century and its projected continuation. 
            Global surface temperature increased 0.74 ± 0.18<SUP><FONT size=3>o</FONT></SUP>C (1.33 ± 0.32<SUP><FONT size=3>o</FONT></SUP>F) during the last century. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concludes that most of the observed temperature increase 
            since the middle of the 20th century was causedby increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases resulting from human activity such as fossil fuel 
            burning and deforestation. The IPCC also concludes that variations in natural phenomena such as solar radiation and volcanoes produced most of 
            the warming from pre-industrial times to 1950 and had a small cooling effect afterward. These basic conclusions have been endorsed by more than 
            40 scientific societies and academies of science, including all of the national academies of science of the major industrialized countries.<P>
            
            Climate model projections summarized in the latest IPCC report indicate that the global surface temperature will probably rise a further 1.1 
            to 6.4<SUP><FONT size=3> o </FONT></SUP>C (2.0 to 11.5<FONT size=3> <SUP> o </FONT> </SUP> F) during the twenty-first century. 
            The uncertainty in this estimate arises from the use of models with differing sensitivity to greenhouse gas concentrations and the use of 
            differing estimates of future greenhouse gas emissions. Some other uncertain ties include how warming and related changes will vary from 
            region to region around the globe. Most studies focus on the period up to the year 2100. However, warming is expected to continue beyond 2100 
            even if emissions stop, because of the large heat capacity of the oceans and the long lifetime of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. <P>
            An increase in global temperature will cause sea levels to rise and will change the amount and pattern of precipitation, probably including 
            expansion of subtropical deserts. The continuing retreat of glaciers, permafrost and sea ice is expected, with warming being strongest in the 
            Arctic. Other likely effects include increases in the intensity of extreme weather events, species extinctions, and changes in agricultural 
            yields.<P>
            Political and public debate continues regarding climate change, and what actions (if any) to take in response. The available options are
            mitigation to reduce further emissions; adaptation to reduce the damage caused by warming; and, more speculatively, geoengineering to reverse 
            global warming. Most national governments have signed and ratified the Kyoto Protocol aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. <P><P><P>

            The most commonly discussed measure of global warming is the trend in globally averaged temperature near the Earth's surface. Expressed as a 
            lineartrend, this temperature rose by 0.74°C ± 0.18°C over the period 1906-2005. The rate of warming over the last half of that period was 
            almost double that for the period as a whole (0.13°C ± 0.03°C per decade, versus 0.07°C ± 0.02°C per decade). The urban heat island effect is 
            estimated to account for about 0.002 °C of warming per decade since 1900. Temperatures in the lower troposphere have increased between 0.12 
            and 0.22 °C (0.22 and 0.4 °F) per decade since 1979, according to satellite temperature measurements. Temperature is believed to have been 
            relatively stable over the one or two thousand years before 1850, with regionally-varying fluctuations such as the Medieval warm Period or 
            the Little Ice Age.<P>

            The greenhouse effect is the process by which absorption and emission of infrared radiation by gases in the atmosphere warm a planet's lower 
            atmosphere and surface. It was discovered by Joseph Fourier in 1824 and was first investigated quantitatively by Svante Arrhenius in 1896.
            Naturally occurring greenhouse gases have a mean warming effect of about 33 °C (59 °F). The major greenhouse gases are water vapor, which 
            causes about 36-70 percent of the greenhouse effect; carbon dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>), which causes 9-26 percent; methane (CH<SUB>4</SUB>), 
            which causes 4-9 percent [not in citation given]; and ozone (O<SUB>3</SUB>), which causes 3-7 percent. Clouds also affect the radiation balance, 
            but they are composed of liquid water or ice and so are considered separately from water vapor and other gases.<P>
            Human activity since the Industrial Revolution has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to increased radiative 
            forcing from CO<SUB>2</SUB>, methane, tropospheric ozone, CFCs and nitrous oxide.<P>
            The destruction of stratospheric ozone by chlorofluorocarbons is sometimes mentioned in relation to global warming. Although there are a few 
            areas of linkage, the relationship between the two is not strong. Reduction of stratospheric ozone has a cooling influence, but substantial 
            ozone depletion did not occur until the late 1970s. Tropospheric ozone contributes to surface warming.<P>

                    Sparse records indicate that glaciers have been retreating since the early 1800s. In the 1950s measurements began that allow the monitoring 
                    of glacial mass balance, reported to the WGMS and the NSIDC.

            It usually is impossible to connect specific weather events to global warming. Instead, global warming is expected to cause changes in the 
            overall distribution and intensity of events, such as changes to the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation. Broader effects are 
            expected to include glacial retreat, Arctic shrinkage, and worldwide sea level rise. Some effects on both the natural environment and human 
            life are, at least in part, already being attributed to global warming. <P>
            Additional anticipated effects include sea level rise of 0.18 to 0.59 meters (0.59 to 1.9 ft) in 2090-2100 relative to 1980-1999, new trade 
            routes resulting from arctic shrinkage, possible thermohaline circulation slowing, increasingly intense (but less frequent) hurricanes and 
            extreme weather events, reductions in the ozone layer, changes in agriculture yields, changes in the range of climate-dependent disease vectors, 
            which has been linked to increases in the prevalence of malaria and dengue fever, and ocean oxygen depletion. <P>

            The main positive feedback in global warming involves the tendency of warming to increase the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere. The main 
            negative feedback in global warming is the effect of temperature on emission of infrared radiation : as the temperature of a body increases, 
            the emitted radiation increases with the fourth power of its absolute temperature.<P>

            </FONT> 
            If the atmosphere is warmed, the saturation vapor pressure increases, and the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere will tend to increase. 
            Since water vapor is a greenhouse gas, the increase in water vapor content makes the atmosphere warm further; this warming causes the 
            atmosphere to hold still more water vapor (a positive feedback), and so on until other processes stop the feedback loop. The result is a much 
            larger greenhouse effect than that due to CO<sub>2</sub> alone. Although this feedback process causes an increase in the absolute moisture 
            content of the air, the relative humidity stays nearly constant or even decreases slightly because the air is warmer.<P>

                <H3>Cloud feedback</H3> <P>  
            </FONT>
            warming is expected to change the distribution and type of clouds. Seen from below, clouds emit infrared radiation back to the surface, and so 
            exert a warming effect; seen from above, clouds reflect sunlight and emit infrared radiation to space, and so exert a cooling effect. <P>

                <H3>Lapse rate</H3> <P>
            </FONT>
            The atmosphere's temperature decreases with height in the troposphere. Since emission of infrared radiation varies with temperature, longwave 
            radiation escaping to space from the relatively cold upper atmosphere is less than that emitted toward the ground from the lower atmosphere. 
            Thus, the strength of the greenhouse effect depends on the atmosphere's rate of temperature decrease with height. <P>

                    Aerial photograph showing a section of sea ice. The lighter blue areas are melt ponds and the darkest areas are open water, both have a lower 
                    albedo than the white sea ice. The melting ice contributes to the ice-albedo feedback.

            </CENTER><P> 
            when ice melts, land or open water takes its place. Both land and open water are on average less reflective than ice and thus absorb more solar 
            radiation. This causes more warming, which in turn causes more melting, and this cycle continues. <P>

                <H3>Arctic methane release</H3><P>
            </FONT>
            warming is also the triggering variable for the release of methane in the arctic. Methane released from thawing permafrost such as the 
            frozenpeat bogs in Siberia, and from methane clathrate on the sea floor, creates a positive feedback.<BR>
            Reduced absorption of CO<SUB>2</SUB> by the oceanic ecosystems <BR>
            Ocean ecosystems' ability to sequester carbon is expected to decline as the oceans warm. This is because warming reduces the nutrient levels of 
            the mesopelagic zone (about 200 to 1000 m deep), which limits the growth of diatoms in favor of smaller phytoplankton that are poorer biological 
            pumps of carbon.<BR>
            CO<SUB>2</SUB> release from oceans<BR>
            Cooler water can absorb more CO<SUB>2</SUB>. As ocean temperatures rise some of this CO<SUB>2</SUB> will be released. This is one of the main 
            reasons why atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> is lower during an ice age. There is a greater mass of CO<SUB>2</SUB> contained in the oceans than there 
            is in the atmosphere.<BR>
            Gas release <BR>
            Release of gases of biological origin may be affected by global warming, but research into such effects is at an early stage. Some of these 
            gases, such as nitrous oxide released from peat, directly affect climate. Others, such as dimethyl sulfide released from oceans, have indirect 
            effects.<BR>

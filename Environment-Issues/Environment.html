            One of the primary causes of environmental degradation in a country could be attributed to rapid growth of population, 
            which adversely affects the natural resources and environment. The three basic demographic factors of <I>births (natality), deaths 
            (mortality)</I> and <I>migration </I>and <I>immigration</I> (population moving into a country produces higher population). 
            produce changes in population size, composition, distribution and these changes raise a number of important questions of cause 
            and effect. <P>
            Population growth and economic development are contributing to many serious environmental calamities in India. These include heavy 
            pressure on land, land degradation, forests, habitat destruction and loss of biodiversity. Changing consumption pattern has led to 
            rising demand for energy. The final outcomes of this are air pollution, global warming, climate change, water scarcity and 
            water pollution.<P>
            Environmental issues in India include various natural hazards, particularly cyclones and annual monsoon floods, population growth, 
            increasing individual consumption, industrialization, infrastructural development, poor agricultural practices, and resource 
            maldistribution have led to substantial human transformation of India's natural environment.<P>

        Out of India's 3,119 towns and cities, just 209 have partial treatment facilities, and only 8 have full wastewater treatment facilities 
        (WHO 1992). 114 cities dump untreated sewage and partially cremated bodies directly into the Ganges River. 
        Downstream, the untreated water is used for drinking, bathing, and washing. This situation is typical of many rivers in India as well as 
        other developing countries.<P> 
        Open defecation is widespread even in urban areas of India. <P>
        More than 400 million people live along the Ganges River. An estimated 2,000,000 persons ritually bathe daily in the river, 
        which is considered holy by Indians.<P>

                the concentration is 3,000 times over the safety limit. In places, the Ganges becomes black and septic. Corpses, of semi-cremated

        <P>
        Indian cities are polluted by vehicles and industry emissions. Road dust due to vehicles also contributing up to 33% of air pollution. 
        In cities like Bangalore, around 50% of children suffer from asthma. India has emission standard of Bharat Stage II (Euro II) 
        for vehicles since 2005.<P>
        One of the biggest causes of air pollution in India is from the transport system. Hundreds of millions of old diesel engines 
        continuously burning away diesel which has anything between 150 το 190 times the amount of sulphur out European diesel has. <P>
        It also appeared that the excessive pollution was having an adverse effect on the Taj Mahal.<P>
        Environmental pollution is a global problem and the whole humanity is worried as to how to control it. Each nation is trying its best 
        to reduce the polluting factors to save the human life. with the new advanced research analyses, through satellites, man has been able 
        to find the causes of possible depletion of the Ozone layer and its consequent effects. They talk about pollution through excessive 
        refrigeration, fuel burning, industrial pollution and other such factors, but nobody has been able to imagine about the pollution 
        being caused by the dead bodies when consigned for cremation in non-scientific manner. We cry about the problem but no problem can be 
        solved unless you provide an alternate or solution to it. The four areas identified for pollution namely Air, water, Earth and Space, 
        have been well researched and discovered. The visible areas to the human eye - Earth and water, catch easily the attention but the 
        other two areas of Air and Space, which are invisible to the common eyesight, are under constant study, vigil and remedial efforts.<P>

        The Supreme Court of India gave a significant verdict on noise pollution in 2005.<P>
        Unnecessary honking of vehicles makes for a high decibel level of noise in cities. The use of loudspeakers for political purposes and 
        by temples and mosques make for noise pollution in residential areas. <P>
        Land pollution in India is due to pesticides and fertilizers as well as corrosion <P>

            Energy conservation is the practice of decreasing the quantity of energy used. It may be achieved through efficient energy use, in which 
            case energy use is decreased while achieving a similar outcome, or by reduced consumption of energy services. Energy conservation may 
            result in increase of financial capital, environmental value, national security, personal security, and human comfort. Individuals and 
            organizations that are direct consumers of energy may want to conserve energy in order to reduce energy costs and promote economic security. 
            Industrial and commercial users may want to increase efficiency and thus maximize profit.<P>
            Electrical energy conservation is an important element of energy policy. Energy conservation reduces the energy consumption and energy demand 
            per capita and thus offsets some of the growth in energy supply needed to keep up with population growth. This reduces the rise in energy costs, 
            and can reduce the need for new power plants, and energy imports. The reduced energy demand can provide more flexibility in choosing the most 
            preferred methods of energy production.<P>
            By reducing emissions, energy conservation is an important part of lessening climate change. Energy conservation facilitates the replacement 
            of non-renewable resources with renewable energy. Energy conservation is often the most economical solution tÎ¿ energy shortages, and is a 
            more environmentally benign alternative to increased energy production.<P>

            Bureau of Energy Efficiency is an Indian governmental apex organization created in 2002 responsible for promoting energy efficiency and 
            conservation.<P>

            Since the 1973 energy crisis, energy conservation has been a serious issue in Japan. While the Energy Conservation Center promotes energy 
            efficiency in every aspect, private entities are implementing the efficient use of energy to industries.<P>

            Energy conservation in the United Kingdom has been receiving increased attention over recent years. Key factors behind this are the 
            Government's commitment to reducing carbon emissions, the projected 'energy gap' in UK electricity generation, and the increasing reliance 
            on imports to meet national energy needs. Domestic housing and road transport are currently the two biggest problem areas.<P>
            The UK Government has jointly funded the Energy Saving Trust to promote energy conservation at a consumer, business and community level 
            since 1993.<P>

            The United States is currently the largest single consumer of energy. The U.S. Department of Energy categorizes national energy use in 
            four broad sectors : transportation, residential, commercial, and industrial.
            Energy usage in transportation and residential sectors (about half of U.S. energy consumption) is largely controlled by individual domestic 
            consumers. Commercial and industrial energy expenditures are determined by businesses entities and other facility managers. National energy 
            policy has a significant effect on energy usage across all four sectors. <P><P>

            The forging of metals appears to be a key turning point in the creation of significant air pollution levels. Core samples of glaciers 
            in Greenland indicate increases in air pollution associated with Greek, Roman and chinese metal production.<P>

            </FONT>
            The earliest known writings concerned with pollution were <I>Arabic medical treatises</I> written between the 9th and 13th centuries, 
            by physicians such as <I>al-kindi (Alkindus), Qusta ibn Luqa (Costa ben Luca), Muhammad ibn Zakariya Razi (Rhazes), Ibn Al-Jazzar, 
            al-Tamimi, al-Masihi, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Ali ibn Ridwan, Ibn Jumay, Isaac Israeli ben Solomon, Abd-el-latif, Ibn al-Quff, and 
            Ibn al-Nafis.</I> Their works covered a number of subjects related to pollution such as air contamination, water contamination, 
            soil contamination, solid waste mishandling, and environmental assessments of certain localities.<P>
            King Edward I of England banned the burning of sea-coal by proclamation in London in 1272, after its smoke had become a problem. 
            But the fuel was so common in England that this earliest of names for it was acquired because it could be carted away from some shores 
            by the wheelbarrow. Air pollution would continue to be a problem in England, especially later during the industrial revolution, and extending 
            into the recent past with the Great Smog of 1952. This same city also recorded one of the earlier extreme cases of water quality problems 
            with the Great Stink on the Thames of 1858, which led to construction of the London sewerage system soon afterward.<P>
            It was the industrial revolution that gave birth to environmental pollution as we know it today. The emergence of great factories and 
            consumption of immense quantities of coal and otherfossil fuels gave rise to unprecedented air pollution and the large volume of industrial 
            chemical discharges added to the growing load of untreated human waste. Chicago and Cincinnati were the first two American cities to enact 
            laws ensuring cleaner air in 1881. Other cities followed around the country until early in the 20th century, when the short lived office of 
            Air Pollution was created under the Department of the Interior. Extreme smog events were experienced by the cities of Los Angeles and Donora, 
            Pennsylvania in the late 1940s, serving as another public reminder.<P>

            Pollution became a popular issue after WW2, when the aftermath of atomic warfare and testing made evident the perils of radioactive 
            fallout. Then a conventional catastrophic event The Great Smog of 1952 in London killed at least 8000 people. This massive event 
            prompted some of the first major modern environmental legislation, The <I>Clean Air Act of 1956.</I><P>

                <H3>FORMS OF POLLUTION</H3><P>
            </FONT>    
            The major forms of pollution are listed below along with the particular pollutants relevant to each of them : <P>
            <B>Air pollution</B>, the release of chemicals and particulates into the atmosphere. Common gaseous air pollutants include carbon
            monoxide, sulfur dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and nitrogen oxides produced by industry and motor vehicles.<P>
            <B>Water pollution</B>, by the release of waste products and contaminants into surface runoff into river drainage systems, leaching 
            into groundwater, liquid spills, wastewater discharges, eutrophication littering.<P>
            <B>Soil contamination</B> occurs when chemicals are released by spill or underground leakage. Among the most significant soil 
            contaminants are hydrocarbons, heavy metals, MTBE, herbicides, pesticides and chlorinated hydrocarbons.<P>
            <B>Radioactive contamination</B>0, resulting from 20th century activities in atomic physics, such as nuclear power generation and 
            nuclear weapons research, manufacture and deployment.<P>
            <B>Noise pollution,</B>which encompasses roadway noise, aircraft noise, industrial noise as well as high-intensity sonar.<P>
            <8>Light pollution</B>, includes light trespass, over-illumination and astronomical interference.<P>
            <B>Visual pollution</B>, which can refer to the presence of overhead power lines, motorway billboards, scarred landforms 
            (as from strip mining), open storage of trash or municipal solid waste.<P>
            <B>Thermal pollution</B>, is a temperature change in natural water bodies caused by human influence, such as use of water as coolant 
            in a power plant. <P>

            <I>Main article : Pollutant</I>
            A pollutant is a waste material that pollutes air, water or soil. 
            Three factors determine the severity of a pollutant : its chemical nature, the concentration and the persistence.<P>
            <B>SOURCES AND CAUSES</B><P>
            Air pollution comes from both natural and man made sources. Though globally man made pollutants from combustion, construction, mining, 
            agriculture and warfare are increasingly significant in the air pollution equation.<BR>
            Motor vehicle emissions are one of the leading causes of air pollution. China, United States, Russia, Mexico, and Japan are the world 
            leaders in air pollution emissions. Agricultural air pollution comes from contemporary practices which include clear felling and 
            burning of natural vegetation as well as spraying of pesticides and herbicides.<P>
            Ordinary municipal landfills are the source of many chemical substances entering the soil environment (and often groundwater), 
            emanating from the wide variety of refuse accepted, especially substances illegally discarded there, or from pre-1970 landfills 
            that may have been subject to little control in the U.S. or EU. 
            There have also been some unusual releases of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, commonly called dioxins for simplicity such as TCDD. <P>
            Pollution can also be the consequence of a natural disaster. For example, hurricanes often involve water contamination from sewage,
            and petrochemical spills from ruptured boats orautomobiles, Larger scale and environmental damage is not uncommon when coastal oil 
            rigs or refineries are involved. Some sources of pollution, such as nuclear power plants or oil tankers, can produce widespread and 
            potentially hazardous releases when accidents occur.<P>
            In the case of noise pollution the dominant source class is the motor vehicle, producing about ninety percent of all unwanted noise 
            worldwide.<P>

                <H3>EFFECTS</H3><P>
            </FONT>
            <B>Human Health</B><BR>
            Adverse air quality can kill many organisms including humans. Ozone pollution can cause respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, 
            throat inflammation, chest pain, and congestion. Water pollution causes approximately 14,000 deaths per day, mostly due to contamination 
            of drinking water by untreated sewage in developing countries. In India, air pollution is believed to cause 527,700 fatalities a year.<P>
            Oil spills can cause skin irritations and rashes. Noise pollution induces hearing loss, high blood pressure, stress, and sleep disturbance. 
            Mercury has been linked to developmental deficits in children and neurologic symptoms. Older people are majorly exposed to diseases induced 
            by air pollution. Those with heart or lung disorders are under additional risk. Children and infants are also at serious risk. Lead and 
            other heavy metals have been shown to cause neurological problems. Chemical and radioactive substances can cause cancer and as well as birth 
            defects.<P>
            <B>Environment</B>
            Pollution has been found to be present widely in the environment.
            There are a number of effects of this :<BR>
            Sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides can cause acid rain which lowers the pH value of soil.<BR>
            Nitrogen oxides are removed from the air by rain and fertilise land which can change the species composition of ecosystems.<BR>
            Soil can become infertile and unsuitable for plants. This will affect other organisms in the food web.<BR>
            Smog and haze can reduce the amount of sunlight received by plants to carry out photosynthesis and leads to the production of 
            tropospheric ozone which damages plants.<BR>
            Invasive species can out compete native species and reduce biodiversity.<BR>
            Carbon dioxide emissions cause ocean acidification, the ongoing decrease in the pH of the Earth's oceans as CO<SUB>2</SUB> becomes 
            dissolved.<BR>
            The emission of greenhouse gases leads to global warming which affects ecosystems in many ways.<P>
            <B>Regulation and Monitoring</B>
            <I>Main article : Regulation and monitoring of pollution.</I><P>
            To protect the environment from the adverse effects of pollution, many nations worldwide have enacted legislation to regulate various 
            types of pollution as well as to mitigate the adverse effects of pollution.<P>
            <B>Pollution Control</B><P>
            Pollution control is a term used in environmental management. It means the control of emissions and effluents into air, water off soil. 
            Without pollution control, the waste products from consumption, heating, agriculture, mining, manufacturing, transportation and other 
            human activities, whether they accumulate or disperse, will degrade the environment. In the hierarchy of controls, pollution prevention 
            and waste minimization are more desirable than pollution control.<P>

            </FONT>
            "The solution to pollution is dilution", is a dictum which summarizes a traditional approach to pollution management whereby 
            sufficiently diluted pollution is not harmful. It is well-suited to some other modern, locally-scoped applications such as laboratory 
            safety procedure and hazardous material release emergency management. But it assumes that the dilutant is in virtually unlimited 
            supply for the application or that resulting dilutions are acceptable in all cases. <P>
            Such simple treatment for environmental pollution on a wider scale might have had greater merit in earlier centuries when physical 
            survival was often the highest imperative, human population and densities were lower, technologies were simpler and their byproducts 
            more benign. But these are often no longer the case.<P>
